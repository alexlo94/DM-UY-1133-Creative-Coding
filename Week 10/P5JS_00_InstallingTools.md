# Installing Visual Studio Code and the LiveServer Extension

p5.js is a javaScript library which means it runs on a webpage, along with HTML and CSS. In order to get started with p5 we're going to need to establish a workflow that will let us quickly and easily edit HTML/CSS/JS files, set up a local development server, and push to our GitHub repo all at once. That editor is none other than Visual Studio Code (aka vscode). You can use other editors like atom and sublime for web development but this guide os for vscode.


Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download the appropriate version for your machine. Once installed, open your homework folder [File > Open Folder] (which should be a git repository as well) and check out the side menu which contains the Explorer, Search, Source Control, Debug, and Extensions buttons. Hit the Extensions button and search for "Live Server". It should match the extension found here:

Once you have this extension installed, right click on any HTML/JS document and "Open on Live Server" to launch a local host for your sketches.
