<!--This is an HTML comment.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is a tag-based system that decides the content of your webpage
In general, a tag will open and close as follows:

    <tagName>Content</tagName>

For example, a common tag that denotes a paragraph of text is the <p> tag:

    <p>This is a paragraph of text and it'll be rendered in the browser as one!</p>

Tags can have attributes that denote specific characteristics about them.
HTML specifies web links through the <a> tag and in order to denote the destination of the link the a tag is given an href attribute as follows:
    
    <a href = "https://www.google.com">Click here to go to Google!</a>

Finally, every html document has a head and a body section and they're denoted by the special <head> and <body> tags.
Tags in the <head> section will not be rendered in the browser window and are generally used for webpage settings, the title, and links to CSS/JS documents.
Tags in the <body> section will be rendered as normal and make up the visual component of your website.

There is much much more to HTML than this general pattern and just like with CSS, I am by no means an authority on the subject.
